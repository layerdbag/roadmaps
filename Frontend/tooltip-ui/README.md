# A tooltip

A tooltip for navigation items

Creating a tooltip for navigation items while making use of only HTML and CSS

It was fun to create, reactivating some CSS stuff that I have forgotten due to the use of other tools or frameworks!

It was great using CSS positioning and setting `{ position: relative; }` property on the parent element so that its child items will be set relative to its position.

## Instructions on how to run the project

- You need to copy the project folder to any text editor
- You can then double click on the `index.html` file or use a liveserver extension in your favourite text editor to run it.
